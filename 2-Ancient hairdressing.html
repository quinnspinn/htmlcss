                <p>Hairdressing as an occupation dates back thousands of years.  Ancient art drawings and paintings have been<br /> 
                   discovered depicting people working on another person's hair. Greek writers Aristophanes and Homer both mention<br /> 
                   hairdressing in their writings. In Africa, it was believed in some cultures that a person's spirit occupied his<br />  
                   or her hair, giving hairdressers high status within these communities. The status of hairdressing encouraged<br /> 
                   many to develop their skills, and close relationships were built between hairdressers and their clients.<br />  
                   Hours would be spent washing, combing, oiling, styling and ornamenting their hair. Men would work specifically on men,<br />  
                   and women on other women. Before a master hairdresser died, they would give their combs and tools to a chosen<br />  
                   successor during a special ceremony.<br /> 
                   <br /> 
                   In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors and<br />  
                   styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers within their home.<br />  
                   With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as hairdressers. In ancient Rome and<br />  
                   Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including dyeing and shaving. Men who did not<br />  
                   have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and<br />  
                   groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century until the 14th<br />  
                   century. Hair care service grew in demand after a papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman Catholic clergymen remove<br />  
                   their facial hair.</p>
