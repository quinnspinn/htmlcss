                   <p>Occupationally, hairdressing is expected to grow faster than the average for all other occupations, at 20%. A state license is required<br /> 
                   for hairdressers to practice, with qualifications varying from state to state. Generally a person interested in hairdressing must have a high<br /> 
                   school diploma or GED, be at least 16 years of age, and have graduated from a state-licensed barber or cosmetology school. Full-time programs<br /> 
                   often last 9 months or more, leading to an associate degree. After students graduate from a program, they take a state licensing exam, which<br /> 
                   often consists of a written test, and a practical test of styling or an oral exam. Hairdressers must pay for licenses, and occasionally licenses<br /> 
                   must be renewed. Some states allow hairdressers to work without obtaining a new license, while others require a new license. About 44% of hairdressers<br /> 
                   are self-employed, often putting in 40-hour work weeks, and even longer among the self-employed. In 2008, 29% of hairstylists worked part-time, and 14%<br /> 
                   had variable schedules. As of 2008, people working as hairdressers totaled about 630,700, with a projected increase to 757,700 by 2018.</p>
