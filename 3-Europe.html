                <p>The first appearance of the word "hairdresser" is in 17th century Europe, and hairdressing was considered a profession.<br />   
                   Hair fashion of the period suggested that wealthy women wear large, complex and heavily adorned hairstyles, which would<br />   
                   be maintained by their personal maids and other people, who would spend hours dressing the woman's hair. A wealthy man's<br />   
                   hair would often be maintained by a valet. It was in France where men began styling women's hair for the first time, and<br />   
                   many of the notable hairdressers of the time were men, a trend that would continue into contemporary times. The first famous<br />   
                   male hairdresser was Champagne, who was born in Southern France. Upon moving to Paris, he opened his own hair salon and dressed<br />  
                   the hair of wealthy Parisian women until his death in 1658.<br />  
                   <br />
                   Women's hair grew taller in style during the 17th century, popularized by the hairdresser Madame Martin. The hairstyle,<br />   
                   "the tower," was the trend with wealthy English and American women, who relied on hairdressers to style their hair as tall<br />   
                   as possible. Tall piles of curls were pomaded, powdered and decorated with ribbons, flowers, lace, feathers and jewelry. The<br />   
                   profession of hairdressing was launched as a genuine profession when Legros de Rumigny was declared the first official<br />   
                   hairdresser of the French court. In 1765 de Rumigny published his book Art de la Coiffure des Dames, which discussed<br />   
                   hairdressing and included pictures of hairstyles designed by him. The book was a best seller amongst Frenchwomen, and four years<br />   
                   later de Rumigny opened a school for hairdressers: Academie de Coiffure. At the school he taught men and women to cut hair and<br />   
                   create his special hair designs.<br />  
                   <br />
                   By 1777, approximately 1,200 hairdressers were working in Paris. During this time, barbers formed unions, and demanded that<br />  
                   hairdressers do the same. Wigmakers also demanded that hairdressers cease taking away from their trade, and hairdressers responded<br />  
                   that their roles were not the same, hairdressing was a service, and wigmakers made and sold a product. de Rumigny died in 1770 and<br />  
                   other hairdressers gained in popularity, specifically three Frenchmen: Frederic, Larseueur, and LÃ©onard. Leonard and Larseueur were<br />  
                   the stylists for Marie Antoinette. Leonard was her favorite, and developed many hairstyles that became fashion trends within wealthy<br />  
                   Parisian circles, including the loge d'opera, which towered five feet over the wearer's head. During the French Revolution he escaped<br />  
                   the country hours before he was to be arrested, alongside the king, queen, and other clients. He emigrated to Russia, where he worked<br />  
                   as the premier hairdresser for Russian nobility.</p>
