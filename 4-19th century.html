<h2>19th century</h2>
                   <p>Parisian hairdressers continued to develop influential styles during the early 19th century. Wealthy French women would have their<br />  
                   favorite hairdressers style their hair from within their own homes, a trend seen in wealthy international communities. Hairdressing was<br />  
                   primarily a service affordable only to those wealthy enough to hire professionals or to pay for servants to care for their hair. In the<br />  
                   United States, Marie Laveau was one of the most famous hairdressers of the period. Laveau, located in New Orleans, began working as a<br /> 
                   hairdresser in the early 1820s, maintaining the hair of wealthy women of the city. She was a voodoo practitioner, called the "Voodoo<br /> 
                   Queen of New Orleans," and she used her connections to wealthy women to support her religious practice. She provided "help" to women<br />  
                   who needed it for money, gifts and other favors.
                   <br />
                   French hairdresser Marcel Grateau developed the "Marcel wave" in the late part of the century. His wave required the use of a special<br /> 
                   hot hair iron and needed to be done by an experienced hairdresser. Fashionable women asked to have their hair "marceled." During this<br /> 
                   period, hairdressers began opening salons in cities and towns, led by Martha Matilda Harper, who developed one of the first retail<br /> 
                   chains of hair salons, the Harper Method. Beauty salons became popularized during the 20th century, alongside men's barbershops.<br /> 
                   These spaces served as social spaces, allowing women to socialize while having their hair done and other services such as facials.<br /> 
                   Wealthy women still had hairdressers visit their home, but, the majority of women visited salons for services, including high-end salons<br /> 
                   such as Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Salon.
                   <br />
                   Major advancements in hairdressing tools took place during this period. Electricity led to the development of permanent wave machines<br />  
                   and hair dryers. These tools allowed hairdressers to promote visits to their salons, over limited service in-home visits. New coloring<br />  
                   processes were developed, including those by Eugene Schueller in Paris, which allowed hairdressers to perform complicated styling techniques.<br />  
                   After World War I, the bob cut and the shingle bob became popular, alongside other short haircuts. In the 1930s complicated styles came back<br />  
                   into fashion, alongside the return of the Marcel wave. Hairdressing was one of the few acceptable professions during this time for women,<br />  
                   alongside teaching, nursing and clerical work.</p>
